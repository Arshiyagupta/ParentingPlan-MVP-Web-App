# UI Development Plan - SafeTalk MVP

## Design principles (MVP)

**Tone:** warm, neutral, non-judgmental. Reduce arousal and ambiguity.

**Layout:** single-column on mobile; centered, narrow two-column on desktop where helpful.

**Colors:** light UI with gentle neutrals; one accent.
- Background #F8FAFC (slate-50), Surface #FFFFFF, Text #0F172A (slate-900)
- Accent (brand): SafeTalk Green #218314 (buttons, active slot ring)
- Muted/Locked: #E5E7EB (gray-200), text #64748B (slate-500)
- Success: #16A34A; Warning (guardrail): #F59E0B

**Type:** System stack or Inter. Headings: semibold; body: normal; line-height 1.5+

**Motion:** minimal; subtle hover/focus; no bouncy animations (avoid agitating users)

**Accessibility:** 16px min body, 44px hit targets, WCAG AA contrast, focus outlines, ARIA labels

**Microcopy:** short, specific, validating (e.g., "We'll help you word this so it lands well.")

## Component inventory (build once, reuse)

**AppShell/Header**
- Left: wordmark "SafeTalk"
- Right: discreet user menu (email, "Log out")

**Buttons:** Primary (accent), Secondary (ghost), Destructive (red, rarely)

**Inputs:** Text, Email, Password (+ show/hide), Textarea (autosize), Validation text

**Cards:** Elevated surface for scorecard slots, chat area, empty states

**Badges/Chips:** "Active", "Locked", "Completed"

**Banner/Notice:** "Waiting for your co-parent to respond" (info state)

**Modal/Drawer:** Invite co-parent

**Toast:** success/error (top-right)

**Progress indicator:** 0/10 to 10/10 (linear bar)

**Avatar/Initials:** simple circle with initials (A/B) for chat bubbles

**Icons:** check (âœ“), lock (ðŸ”’), mail, hourglass, info

## Route map (Next.js)

- `/` Landing
- `/signup`, `/login`
- `/dashboard` (Scorecard)
- `/slot/[round]` (AI Brainstorm Chat for given round)
- `/connect` (fallback manual code entryâ€”rarely used)

Emails are templates (not routes) but we'll note their content.

  - Tone toggles (optional later): softer / direct (for MVP, keep static copy)

**States & Rules**
- First submit â†’ send user draft to AI â†’ render AI suggestion
- Green-Light: confirms and locks the approved_text for this round; then:
  - If you're Parent A on Round 1: open the Invite Co-parent Modal immediately
  - Otherwise: navigate back to /dashboard with success toast "Saved!"
- Block toxic phrasing: if user inputs aggressive words, show inline nudge:
  - "Let's rephrase so it's easier to receive. Try focusing on the positive behavior or impact."

### 6) Invite Co-parent (Modal)

**Purpose:** After Parent A completes Round 1, invite B.

- Primary: Connect
- On success â†’ /dashboard
- If accessed from invite link, prefill code and auto-submit on sign-up

### 8) Completion (/complete)

**Purpose:** Positive reinforcement after 10/10.

**Layout**
- Large checkmark + "10 Good Qualities Completed"
- Grid or list of all 10 approved statements
- Soft CTA (future): "Name one conflict to work on later" (disabled or simple text area stored only)
- Button: Back to scorecard

**States**
- Route is available once pair == completed

## Email templates (for reference)

**Invite:** Subject "{A} shared a good quality about you â€” your turn?"
Body: A's approved text + button "Join & Respond" (link includes token + code)

**Turn notification:** Subject "Your turn to add Good Quality #{n}"
Body: small recap + button "Open your turn"

(These aren't app screens, but the copy shapes expectations and the next UI state.)

## UI states & visuals to implement carefully

**Slot Card States**
- Active: white card, accent ring, "Your turn", primary CTA
- Locked: gray, lock icon, small caption "Unlocks after your co-parent responds"
- Completed: white, check icon, shows approved text, "See more"

**Banners**
- Success ("Saved!")
- Info ("Waiting for your co-parent to respond")
- Error ("Couldn't send invite. Try again.")

**Progress**
- Linear bar labeled "{count}/10 qualities approved"
- Increment when a slot is green-lit and written to DB

**Toasts**
- Short, non-intrusive; auto-dismiss in 3â€“4s

**Focus management**
- On modal open: focus email input
- On route change: focus H1
- Keyboard navigable (tab order, ESC closes modal)

7. Sees A's Round 1 completed; their Slot 1 Active
8. Opens /slot/1 â†’ Green-Lights â†’ back to /dashboard

**Both (Rounds 2â€“5)**
10. Alternate: active â†’ chat â†’ green-light â†’ notify partner â†’ next slot unlocks
11. Progress climbs to 10/10

**Completion**
12. When both finish Round 5 â†’ /complete (summary) â†’ "Back to scorecard"
